# Uncommenting this line will use a pre-built illumos-omnios, instead of having
# us build it.  NOTE: A build of illumos-omnios can be launched concurrently in
# conjunction with setting this variable. See functions.sh:wait_for_prebuilt().

# These two should be uncommented and set to specific git changeset IDs
# if illumos-kvm and illumos-kvm-cmd get too far ahead of illumos-{gate,omnios}.
# NOTE -> These two values reflect the current known-to-work revisions.
# If a revision matches tip, you don't need to uncomment it.  If it is behind
# tip, you MUST uncomment it, or KVM/KVM-cmd won't build.
