Variables
---------

There are several variables which can be set or adjusted to influence the
build. These include:

    CONFIGURE_OPTS      Generic configuration options, such as --enable-feature
    CPPFLAGS            C pre-processor options.
    CFLAGS              C compiler options.
    CXXFLAGS            C++ compiler options.
    LDFLAGS             Linker options.

Each of these is actually an associative array, keyed on things like the target
architecture. For example, the following options are available for CFLAGS:

    CFLAGS              Compiler options common to all architectures.
    CFLAGS[i386]        Compiler options specific to i386 (default: -m32)
    CFLAGS[amd64]       Compiler options specific to amd64 (default: -m64)

The same variations are available for the other variables too, and
CONFIGURE_OPTS has some additional ones.

    CONFIGURE_OPTS          Configuration options for all architectures. Empty
                            by default.
    CONFIGURE_OPTS[WS]      As CONFIGURE_OPTS but for arguments that contain
                            whitespace.
    CONFIGURE_OPTS[i386]    Options for i386. By default this contains standard
                            autoconf settings system directories, including
                            --prefix, --sysconfdir, etc. The default values of
                            these options depend on whether ISAEXEC is in use
                            and are reset after any call to `set_arch'.
    CONFIGURE_OPTS[i386_WS] As [i386] but can contain whitespace.

In these, i386 is just an example that should be replaced with the name of
the target architecture (i386, amd64 or aarch64).

The following convenience macro exists too:

    LIBDIRS[i386]           "lib"
    LIBDIRS[amd64]          "lib/amd64"
    LIBDIRS[aarch64]        "lib"

The following variables are also available. These have not yet been converted
to associative arrays but likely will be in the future:

    MAKE_ARGS
    MAKE_ARGS_WS
    MAKE_TARGET
    MAKE_INSTALL_TARGET     (Default: install)
    MAKE_INSTALL_ARGS
    MAKE_INSTALL_ARGS_WS
    MAKE_INSTALL_ARGS_32
    MAKE_INSTALL_ARGS_64
    MAKE_TESTSUITE_ARGS     (Default: --quiet)
    MAKE_TESTSUITE_ARGS_WS


Hooks
-----

The main build() function is responsible for running the clean, configure, make
and install tasks in turn. There are also various optional hooks which can be
defined in the build.sh script. The list below shows the normal call flow of
build(), with the optional hooks indicated with a leading '*'. If the build
script defines a function with the hook name then it will be called with the
indicated argument.

build
    *build_init
     foreach arch
         build_<arch>
            *pre_build <arch>	<- return false to skip build for this arch
             make_clean_<arch>
                *pre_clean <arch>
                 make_clean <arch>
                *post_clean <arch>
             configure_<arch>
                *pre_configure <arch>  <- return false to skip configure
                 configure_arch <arch>
                *post_configure <arch>
             make_prog_<arch>
                *pre_make <arch>
                 make_arch <arch>
                *post_make <arch>
             make_install_<arch>
                *pre_install <arch>
                 make_install <arch> [options]
                *post_install <arch>
            *post_build <arch>
    *build_fini

make_package
    *pre_package <arch>
    make_package_impl
    *pre_publish
    *post_package <arch>
