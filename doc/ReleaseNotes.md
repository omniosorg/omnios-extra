### Upgrading from OmniTI-released r151022

All OmniOS packages are signed and the pkg installer is configured to only
allow trusted sources for the core packages. In order to upgrade to the new
OmniOS community edition, you have to let your box know that the updates will
be coming from a new trusted source. This means you will have to import our CA
certificate into your system.

Get a copy of the new certificate
```
# /usr/bin/wget -P /etc/ssl/pkg https://downloads.omniosce.org/ssl/omniosce-ca.cert.pem 
```
Check the certificate fingerprint
```
# /usr/bin/openssl x509 -fingerprint  -in /etc/ssl/pkg/omniosce-ca.cert.pem -noout 
8D:CD:F9:D0:76:CD:AF:C1:62:AF:89:51:AF:8A:0E:35:24:4C:66:6D
```

Change the publisher to our new repository:

```
# /usr/bin/pkg set-publisher -P \
  -G https://pkg.omniti.com/omnios/r151022/ \
  -g https://pkg.omniosce.org/r151022/core/ omnios 
```

For each native zone (if you have any), run

```
# /usr/bin/pkg -R <zone_root> set-publisher -P \
   -G https://pkg.omniti.com/omnios/r151022/ \
   -g https://pkg.omniosce.org/r151022/core/ omnios 
```
> (get a list of all your zones by running zoneadm list -cv for the
> <zone_root>, add /root to the PATH given in the list.)

Install the new ca-bundle containing our new CA
```
# /usr/bin/pkg update -rv web/ca-bundle 
```
Remove the CA file imported by hand
```
# rm /etc/ssl/pkg/omniosce-ca.cert.pem 
```
Finally update as usual
```
# /usr/bin/pkg update -rv 
```
