## r151024l (2018-01-24)

Weekly release for w/c 22nd of January 2018.
> This is a non-reboot update.

### Security fixes

* `bind` updated to 9.10.6-P1:
  * [CVE-2017-3145](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-3145)
* `curl` updated to 7.58.0
  * [CVE-2018-1000005](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-824a.html)
  * [CVE-2018-1000007](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-b3bf.html)

### Other Changes

* **Update `system/cpuid` package.** Amongst other improvements, this new
  version can report on support for the new speculation control and branch
  predictor instructions added via microcode updates.
  ```
	# cpuid | egrep 'IBRS|STI'
	  Speculation Control (IBRS and IBPB)
	  Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictors (STIBP)
  ```

* **Fix IPv6 multicast related kernel panic.**
  This is a rare problem which has only been reported by one OmniOS user.
  Therefore we have not published the updated package to the IPS repository
  as it would force a reboot; it will be included in the next reboot
  update for r151024. If you need this fix in the meantime, it is
  [available for download](https://downloads.omniosce.org/pkg/8653-udp-backport_r24.p5p). See [illumos issue 8653](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8653).

* **Support booting from RAIDZ2 or RAIDZ3 ZFS pools.**
  This change has not been published to the repository as it would force a
  reboot for all users and only benefits new installations; new installation
  media have been prepared incorporating the fix. See
  [illumos issue 8969](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8969)

* **Fix extended attribute related kernel panic.**
  This change has not yet been published to the repository as it would force
  a reboot for all users and has only been reported by one user. It will be
  rolled up into the next release. If you need this fix in the meantime, it is
  [available for download](https://downloads.omniosce.org/pkg/8806-backport_r24.p5p). See [illumos issue 8806](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8806).

## New features since r151022

### System Features

* Support for SuSE linux images within lx zones, courtesy of Joyent.

* Better support for `systemd` within lx zones.

* Improvements to zone RSS tracking and speed of memory usage determination.

* Loader can now handle disks with native 4k sectors.

* `svcs -Z` no longer emits an error message for zones which do not have SMF.

* The GCC C++ compiler now supports `__cxa_atexit` which is required for
  fully standards-compliant handling of static destructors.

* Java is now an optional package, only required if you use the dynamic
  resource pools feature. After upgrade to r151024, you can remove java
  if desired as follows:

  `omnios# pkg uninstall runtime/java java/jdk service/resource-pools/poold`

* The `openssl` package now contains both OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0, managed
  by a versioned variant. This is the first step on the two year plan to
  upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1 before the end-of-life date for 1.0. Note that
  OmniOS itself does not yet build with OpenSSL 1.1. For more information
  and a list of affected parts of OmniOS, see the
  [repository README file](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/tree/master/build/openssl)

* The `package/pkg/depot`, `package/pkg/system-repository` and
  `package/pkg/zones-proxy` packages have been removed from OmniOS.
  The first two were not previously installable without work and the
  latter could only be installed in a non-global zone, where it did no good
  without the corresponding part in the global zone.
  `package/pkg/zones-proxy` has been marked as obsolete so will be
  automatically removed from non-global zones as they are upgraded.

* `pkg/server` can now serve repositories for publisher names containing
  a hyphen.

* `mountd` and `statd` can now be run on a fixed port.

### Hardware Support

* Support for AVX-512 processor extensions.

* Support for Chelsio T6 Ethernet devices.

* Support for the LSI 9305-24i controller.

* Support for the Intel X722 Ethernet controller.

* Fixes for panic/hang on Xen 4.x

* The `audiovia97` driver has been removed.

### Commands and Command Options

* `zpool scrub -p` to pause a scrub.

* `ipadm -T dhcp -h <hostname>` to specify a hostname that will be sent to
  the DHCP server in order to request an association. Existing DHCP addresses
  can have this added via `ipadm set-addrprop -p reqhost=<hostname> <if>`.

* New `nvmeadm` utility to manage NVMe controllers and namespaces.

* New `zfs program` facility to run lua scripts to perform batch
  administrative ZFS operations.
  See [Issue 7431](https://www.illumos.org/issues/7431) for more details,
  man page and examples.

* `xargs` has a new option `-P <maxprocs>` to run up to *maxprocs* parallel
  child processes.

* `last` has a new option `-l` to show longer dates and times, including
  the current year.

* `svcadm` now handles multiple partial FMRI arguments as long as each
  is unambiguous.
  
* `tail` now properly supports `-[cb] <num>` as an alternative syntax
  for `-<num>[cb]`.

### Developer Features

* `ld` now handles arguments of the form `-Wl,-z,aslr` (two commas).
  This is a compiler argument which should result in the linker being called
  with `-z aslr` but some buggy build systems pass it directly to the
  linker.

* GCC 5 has been upgraded to 5.5.0 and **moved to `/opt/gcc-5`** to reflect
  the new numbering scheme used from version 5 onwards. The mediated symlinks
  in /usr/bin are still the best way to invoke GCC but you may need to update
  your `$PATH` or scripts if you have previously explicitly used
  `/opt/gcc-5.1.0`.

* GCC version 6 is now available - `pkg install developer/gcc6` - and can be
  found in `/opt/gcc-6`.
  Note that GCC 6's default standard for C++ is `-std=gnu++14`. This is a
  change from GCC 5 which used `-std=gnu++98`. Some software may assume
  gnu++98 and to compile it with GCC 6 you will need to specify
  `--std=gnu++98` or update the software. More detail on the changes in GCC 6
  can be found on
  [the gcc web site](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-6/changes.html).

* Perl has been upgraded to 5.24.3 and the components have been renamed to
  remove the minor version from paths. This means that modules no longer
  have to be rebuilt/moved following minor perl upgrades. The version of perl
  shipped with OmniOS is for internal system use and should not be relied on
  for anything else.

* All of the constraints delivered under `incorporation/jeos/omnios-userland`
  are now protected with `version-lock` facets. This allows each constraint
  to be selectively disabled. This is most useful for people developing
  OmniOS but can also aid temporary local package updates. Example:

  `omnios# pkg change-facet version-lock.web/wget=false`

  To revert, set the facet to `none`

  `omnios# pkg change-facet version-lock.web/wget=none`

* New `omnios-build-tools` package to easily install everything required to
  build OmniOS userland.

* It is now possible to build OmniOS in a non-global zone (with the caveat
  that it is not possible to build release media in a NGZ).

### Deprecated features

* The `calendar` utility has been removed.
* The `audiovia97` driver has been removed.
* GCC version 5 will be removed in the next stable version of OmniOS, r151026.
