Solaris ld: Provided assembler is not PIC, so we pass "-mimpure-text"
            to the compiler so it doesn't send "-ztext" to ld.

Solaris ld: Passing "-Wa,--noexecstack" to gcc will generate an ELF section
            requesting a non executable stack. I don't know if Solaris ld
            is complying or just ignoring it.
