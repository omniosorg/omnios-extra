'sun' is considered a forbidden identifier by GCC and therefore it creates
a "fixed" version of openssl/opensslconf.h in its library directory.

This breaks the openssl mediation in OmniOS and also prevents the
compiler from seeing any updated version of that file.

To resolve that, the fix that GCC would use is applied directly to the
include file so that it doesn't see a need to fix it.
